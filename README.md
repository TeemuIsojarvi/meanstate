# meanstate
This small program, written with R, calculates the ground state wave function of a quantum system in an unusual way that is based on propagating a trial state along real time axis
and finding the average wave function on some time interval. This is repeated in several iterative steps where the average WF from previous iteration is set as the initial state in a
new iteration round.
